# Heimdall-Mimir

Mimir: The Rememberer

Mimer “The wise one or The rememberer” is known for his knowledge and wisdom in all the nine worlds.

He has his own well called Mimir’s well “Mímisbrunnr”, those who drink from the well will obtain more wisdom.

Odin once drank from the well, and paid for it, by sacrificing an eye to Mimir. 

Heimdall: 

He is the ward of the gods, and sits at the end of heaven, guarding the bridge against the mountain-giants. 

He needs less sleep than a bird; sees an hundred miles around him, and as well by night as by day.

He hears the grass grow and the wool on the backs of the sheep, and of course 

all things that sound louder than these.
